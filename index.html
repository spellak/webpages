    <p>My name is <strong>Srinish Pellakur</strong> and I am currently a first-year student at NC State University.
    I plan on majoring in <ins>computer engineering</ins>. 
    This is because computer engineering captures my interest for both the <em>software and hardware</em> aspects of computers.
    As a combination of both computer science and electrical engineering, I believe I would develop a well rounded quality of knowledge around computers.
    </p>

	<p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px; color: #CC0000; text-align: center;">My dream job is to become a technology-based entrepreneur.
	I aspire to utilize the knowledge I collected by studying computer engineering and use it to develop a business.
	Especially since the technology field is booming in modern times, I believe creating a technology-based corporation would be highly profitable.
